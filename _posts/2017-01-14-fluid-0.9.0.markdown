Fluid is our toolkit for cross-platform and responsive applications that supports Material Design and optionally the Microsoft Universal design language.

Originally an Hawaii library (see [here][fluid-hawaii]), Fluid is the continuation of the project using QtQuick Controls 2 and merging code from [qml-material][qml-material].

It replaces [qml-material][qml-material] which was using QtQuick Controls 1.

Features:

* Supports QtQuick Controls 2.
* Full Material Design support.
* Ships Material Design icons.
* Almost all qml-material components are now available.
* Improved ListItem API.
* Sort filter model.
* Standardized spacing and margins.
* Typography components.
* QStandardPaths wrapper.
* Per-project QMake installation.
* Demo application.
* Initial API documentation.
* Application store friendly license (MPL v2).
