# What is Anima

Anima is a modern, graphical operating system designed around the needs of the modern internet  user.

The operating system itself consists of the following architecutral layers:

* A modern 64 bit kernel (currently, a Linux kernel).
* **Quokka**: A browser doubling as application runtime (a fork of Mozilla Firefox).
* **HuX (Heirloom Unix)**: A low level wrapper library around  libc.
* **junior**: A high level javascript (ES6/CommonJS) SDK containing all the functionality an app developer may need. 
* **Savannah** The user interface (analogous with traditional desktop environments), realised through a set of extensions to Quokka.
* A  set of userspace servers controlling the OS and serving as message brokers (think Plan9 plumber).


# Why?
I've always been quite frustrated with the state of existing operating systems.
Most of them (with the exception of Chrome OS) are sluggish, include a rather bloated, overly orthodox UI
and none of them are doing a particularly good job of engaging the community, let alone breeding new 
developers.

With Anima I'm trying to create an operating system that is not only easy to use but that will, I hope, also
encourage people from all walks of life (be it common users, web designers or professional software
developers) to engage in the development of new software.
